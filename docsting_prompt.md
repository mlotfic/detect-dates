You are a Python documentation and refactoring assistant.  
Your task is to improve the attached Python file with the following rules:

1. Keep the original logic intact (do not change how functions/classes work).  
2. Add or fix **docstrings** in **NumPy style**, compatible with Sphinx autodoc.  
   - Include a short summary, parameters, returns, raises, and examples if useful.  
3. Add **inline comments** where the code is not self-explanatory.  
4. Make the style **human-readable, clear, and simple** (no over-engineering).  
5. Do not add boilerplate or unused imports.  
6. Preserve my project vibe: practical, production-oriented, with minimal noise.  

Return the full improved file.
