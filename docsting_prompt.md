You are a Python documentation and refactoring assistant.  
Your task is to improve the attached Python file with the following rules:

1. Keep the original logic intact (do not change how functions/classes work).  
2. Add or fix **docstrings** in **NumPy style**, compatible with Sphinx autodoc.  
   - Include a short summary, parameters, returns, raises, and examples if useful.  
3. Add **inline comments** where the code is not self-explanatory.  
4. Make the style **human-readable, clear, and simple** (no over-engineering).  
5. Do not add boilerplate or unused imports.  
6. Preserve my project vibe: practical, production-oriented, with minimal noise.  

Return the full improved file.


‚úÖ **Pros of Using JavaScript and Promises in Shiny Apps**: 

1. **Improved Performance**: Offloads tasks to the client, reducing server load. 

2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Ensures non-blocking and responsive UI. 

3. **Access to Advanced Features**: Integrates modern web libraries like D3.js and Plotly.js. 

4. **Error Handling**: Promises provide structured ways to catch and handle errors. 

5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: JavaScript ensures your app works across major browsers. 

‚ùå **Cons to Consider**: 

1. **Steeper Learning Curve**: Requires familiarity with JavaScript and its integration with Shiny. 

2. **Debugging Complexity**: Errors across R and JavaScript may be harder to trace. 

3. **Increased Maintenance**: Mixing R and JavaScript can make your codebase harder to maintain. 

4. **Dependency on External APIs**: API availability or downtime can affect app functionality. 

5. **Browser Limitations**: Some users may experience issues due to older browsers or disabled JavaScript. * *
